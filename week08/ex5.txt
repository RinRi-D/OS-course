Physical address is the actual address in the main memory, whereas virtual address is a logical one that is generated by CPU's MMU.
Virtual address points to the virtual memory, CPU and OS will take that address and convert it to the physical one to access the actual data.
All programs running on OS use virtual addresses, since they don't have access to the physical memory.
