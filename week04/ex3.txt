During the experiment, I have got in total 8 processes for n=3, and 32 processes for n=5.

If we do fork() in a loop, in each iteration of a loop (but not at the same time), the number of processes increases by two (x * 2, where x is the current number of processes).

That is why, in the end, the total number of processes will be 2^n.
